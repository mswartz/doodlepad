# Doodlepad!

Our group project for CS473. Ambition is to build a real-time collaborative note-taking app. 

## Build Setup

You'll need Node, NPM and a few other things, but first check that you have Node and NPM installed. If you're not sure, run

```bash
# check Node version
node -v

#check npm version
npm -v
```
If either of these do not report versions, you'll have to install them. 

Install Node by going here and following the instructions: https://nodejs.org/en/download/

This should also install the latest version of npm (Node Package Manager) which is used to manage the project dependencies. 

## Getting this app up and running

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report
```
